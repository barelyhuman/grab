# getting started 

[grab](/) was built to be used primarily in ci environments where building something from 
scratch isn't possible and getting the binary package / tarball is a much easier and faster solution.

this doesn't mean that you need to build `grab` on the ci everytime, it's available as a binary supporting multiple platforms and for favorable platforms there's easier setup options. 

::: info note
this doesn't cut out the fact that you'll have to depend on one of the installation methods to get `grab` running on the desired system in the first place.
